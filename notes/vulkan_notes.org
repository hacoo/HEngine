** Moving Parts Overview - p. 8

   - Very high level overview of components required to get images on the screen
     
   - 1. Instance / physical device selection
     
     - Create a VkInstance, describing the context of the application
     - Once created: query available hardware
     - Select physical devices (VkPhysicalDevice)
     - Query device properties (e.g., memory)

   - 2. Logical device / family queues
     
     - Logical device: set device features (e.g., floats / doubles)
     - Set up queues - most Vulkan commands are async
     - Queue families line up with logical queue ops
       - e.g., graphics / compute / memory
     

   - 3. Window interface / swap chain

     - Create window for rendering
     - Need: surface, swap chain
     - Totally platform agnostic!
     - Swap chain: collection of render targets
       - Makes sure we aren't rendering what's actually on the screen
       - Request images from chain, draw on them, return them for presentation

   - 4. Image views and framebuffers:

     - Image view: specifies part of image to be used
     - Framebuffer: which view is used for color / depth / stencil
     - Preemtively create image view / FB, select the right one when drawing

   - 5. Render passes

     - Type of image for each render op, how it is used
     - Framebuffer binds actual image to slot

   - 6. Graphics pipeline
     
     - VkPipeline object
     - Describes configurable GFX card state
     - Shader modules, render targets...
     - Pipeline MUST be layed out in advance! But you can swap them out

   - 7. Command pools and command buffers

     - Drawing ops are submitted to queue...
     - Must first be recoreded in command buffer

   - 8. Main loop

     - Acquire image from swap chain
     - Select command buffer, submit to queue
     - Return image to swap chain for presentation
     - Async! Need synchro primitives
   
** Operation overview:

   - Create VkInstance
   - Select GFX device
   - Create device, queue
   - Create window, surface, swap chain
   - Wrap chain in VkImageView
   - Create render pass - rendertargets, usage
   - Create framebuffers
   - Set up pipeline
   - Allocate command buffers
   - Draw frames

** Validation layers

   - Code layers between API and driver
   - You can disable them for release
   - Can write your own, we're using the standard LunarG stuff
** Graphics pipeline
   - Vulkan supports configurable pipelines, but we'll be setting up the following:
     
     - Vertex buffer ->
     - Input assembler (collects raw vertex data) ->
     - Vertex shader (per-vertex shader, apply transform to screen space) ->
     - Tesselation (geometry subdivision) ->
     - Geo shader (Runs on every geo primitive - e.g. lines, triangles. Flexible, but slow, not used much) ->
     - Rasterization (Turn geometry into pixel fragments. Culls.) ->
     - Fragment shader (Invoked on surviving fragments. Decided which framebuffer, color, depth) ->
     - Color Blending (How to mix overlapping fragments) ->
     - Framebuffer

   - Of these, Color Blending and Rasterization are NOT programmable (at least in this setup)
   - Vulkan GFX pipeline is immutable. To change shaders, you must change the pipeline.
     - Therefore, you MUST set up pipelines in advance
     - However, it's faster - the driver can optimize far better
       
** Shader modules
   - Vulkan uses SPIR-V bytecode shaders (why? because GPU vendors kept fucking up the spec)
   - Khronos has a GLSL -> SPIR-V compiler :)
   - Can do this at runtime, or beforehand

** Vertex shaders
   - Processes each incoming vertex
   - input attributes: world position, color, normal, texture coord
   - output: final position in clip coordinates, attributes needed by frag shader
   - clip coord: homogeneous coord that can be turned into a normalized device coord [-1,-1] to [1,1]
   - 
** Pipeline conclusion
   - Shader stages: programmable functionality
   - Fixed function state: input, assembly, rasterizer, etc - non-programmable components
   - Pipeline layout - uniform, push values
   - Render passes - attachments refenced by pipeline stages
